    <p id="lyrics">
      Georgia, wrap me up in all your- <br />
      I want you in my arms <br />
      Oh, let me hold you <br />
      I'll never let you go again like I did <br />
      Oh, I used to say <br />
      <br />
      "I would never fall in love again until I found her" <br />
      I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into" <br />
      I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her <br />
      I found you <br />
      <br />
      Georgia, pulled me in <br />
      I asked to love her once again <br />
      You fell, I caught you <br />
      I'll never let you go again like I did <br />
      Oh, I used to say <br />
      <br />
      "I would never fall in love again until I found her" <br />
      I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into" <br />
      I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her <br />
      I found you <br />
      <br />
      I would never fall in love again until I found her <br />
      I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into" <br />
      I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her <br />
      I found you
